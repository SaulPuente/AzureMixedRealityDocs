### What are Power Apps?

Power Apps is a set of tools that allows you to create applications with a drag and drop UI and easy integration of your data and 3rd party APIs through connectors.  

A [**connector**](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/connectors?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet) is a proxy or a wrapper around an API that allows the underlying service to talk to Microsoft Power Automate, Microsoft Power Apps, and Azure Logic Apps. It provides a way for users to connect their accounts and leverage a set of pre-built **actions** and **triggers** to build their apps and workflows. For example, you can use [Twitter connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/twitter/?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet) to get tweet data and visualize it in a dashboard or use [Twilio connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/twilio/?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet) to send your users text messages without having to be an expert in Twitter or Twilio APIs or having to write a line of code.
