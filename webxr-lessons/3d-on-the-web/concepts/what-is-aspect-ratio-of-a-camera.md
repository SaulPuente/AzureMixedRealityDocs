# What is Aspect Ratio of a Camera?

 The **aspect ratio** a camera defines the rendered image's width and height ratio using the camera. 

You can use the window's inner height and inner width to calculate aspect ratio. If you are not rendering to the entire window, you can choose a specific size for your aspect ratio that would correspond to the container of the renderer.
